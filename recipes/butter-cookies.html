            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These crisp, delicious butter cookies have lots of amazing butter flavor and a melt in your mouth consistency that will have you coming back for more.</p>
            <p>Good old fashioned butter cookies are hard to beat! These holiday staples are delicious any time of the year and the best part is the dough can be made months ahead and baked of for an amazing on demand treat! I love the simple flavors and perfect crumb of the cookie. Theyâ€™re light and not too sweet so I can eat them en mass and still have a skip in my step.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups flour 240g</li>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter 227g</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar 100g</li>
                <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter, salt, and sugar together until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add the egg yolks while mixing. Scrape down sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Add 2 tsp vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Pour in the flour mixture and mix until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough into a log. Wrap in parchment paper or plastic, then chill it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. I've found the best way to keep the dough from flattening out on the bottom is to pop it into an empty cardboard paper towel roll.</li>
                <li>Once the dough is chilled sprinkle sanding sugar on a clean surface. Unwrap the dough and roll in the sugar.</li>
                <li>Use a sharp knife to cut dough into slices of even thickness.</li>
                <li>Place cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake at 350F for 10-12 minutes or until the edge is JUST turning golden brown.</li>
            </ol>

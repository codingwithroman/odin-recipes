            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I wrote before about the television show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo in which a 6 year old child pageant winner from Georgia is the star of her own reality TV show. I was totally sucked into watching the show through a recipe. A friend sent me with the message "You know you want to make Mama June's sketti with ketchup and butter. I know you!" along with a video link. She was right, although when I saw first watched them making it, I was a bit taken aback.</p>
            <p>But it never left my mind and for the next week I wondered what it would taste like. Before you scoff, revered cook Marcella Hazan is well known for her own tomato and butter sauce recipe (although let's be honest, it's not made with ketchup). Even before the show aired, a thread on Chowhound was devoted to this particular concoction with people reminiscing about the recipe having grown up on it. With buttered noodles a European at-home staple, it probably isn't that different from Nigella's Vegemite spaghetti. And if I had found it in some charmin' Southern recipe book ya'll, I would gone straight for it. So I kept mulling it over and wondering if I should make this, just to see what it was like so I made it for Manu and Mr NQN after a day of kite boarding when they'd be ravenously hungry.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>500g/1 pound dried spaghetti</li>
                <li>110g/1 stick butter</li>
                <li>1.5 cups ketchup</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place a big pot of salted water onto boil. Add the spaghetti and cook it according to packet instructions. Drain.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, Mama June put the butter and ketchup in the microwave so that the butter would melt and make a sauce. You can do this or put it in the pot once the pasta is cooked. Coat the pasta with the sauce and add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol>
